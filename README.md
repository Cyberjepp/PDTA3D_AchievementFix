# PDTA3D_AchievementFix
A MelonLoader mod that fixes the Completionist achievement in "Please, Don't Touch Anything 3D".

Specifically it checks all other achievements and, if they're all unlocked, will trigger the "Completionist" achievement shortly after starting the game.

## Installation Instructions
1. Download and run [MelonLoader.Installer.exe](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases/latest)
2. Select the game executable `<steamapps folder>/common/Please Don't Touch Anything 3D/PDTA 3D.exe` to install MelonLoader
    * **NOTE:** You MAY need to change the MelonLoader version to v0.5.7 before pressing INSTALL
3. Download [PDTA3D_AchievementFix.dll](https://github.com/ItsJepp/PDTA3D_AchievementFix/releases/latest) and place into the new `Mods` folder in the game directory

## Troubleshooting
### I can't run MelonLoader
MelonLoader has some requirements which you can find in the [requirements](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/README?id=requirements) section of their documentation.

### The mod doesn't work or crashes the game
The mod was created and tested using MelonLoader **v0.5.7** - if it's not working with other versions, try reinstalling MelonLoader **v0.5.7**.
